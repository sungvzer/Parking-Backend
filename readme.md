## Running the back-end server
There are a few requirements to run this application:
- [Python 3.9.6 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Flask 2.0.1 or newer](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
- [Flask-RESTful 0.3.9 or newer](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-RESTful/)
- [python-dotenv 0.19.0 or newer](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)

After installing the necessary packages, just run `script.py`, having the root of this repository as current directory in the terminal.

Something like this:
